Message from freetype2-2.10.1:

--
The 2.7.x series now uses the new subpixel hinting mode (V40 port's option) as
the default, emulating a modern version of ClearType. This change inevitably
leads to different rendering results, and you might change port's options to
adapt it to your taste (or use the new "FREETYPE_PROPERTIES" environment
variable).

The environment variable "FREETYPE_PROPERTIES" can be used to control the
driver properties. Example:

FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=truetype:interpreter-version=35 \
  cff:no-stem-darkening=1 \
  autofitter:warping=1

This allows to select, say, the subpixel hinting mode at runtime for a given
application.

If LONG_PCF_NAMES port's option was enabled, the PCF family names may include
the foundry and information whether they contain wide characters. For example,
"Sony Fixed" or "Misc Fixed Wide", instead of "Fixed". This can be disabled at
run time with using pcf:no-long-family-names property, if needed. Example:

FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=pcf:no-long-family-names=1

How to recreate fontconfig cache with using such environment variable,
if needed:
# env FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=pcf:no-long-family-names=1 fc-cache -fsv

The controllable properties are listed in the section "Controlling FreeType
Modules" in the reference's table of contents
(/usr/local/share/doc/freetype2/reference/site/index.html, if documentation was installed).

FreeBSD does not, and can not warrant that the certification authorities
whose certificates are included in this package have in any way been
audited for trustworthiness or RFC 3647 compliance.

Assessment and verification of trust is the complete responsibility of the
system administrator.


This package installs symlinks to support root certificates discovery by
default for software that uses OpenSSL.

This enables SSL Certificate Verification by client software without manual
intervention.

If you prefer to do this manually, replace the following symlinks with
either an empty file or your site-local certificate bundle.

  * /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  * /usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem
  * /usr/local/openssl/cert.pem

To run tcsd automatically, add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

Message from doas-6.2:

--
To use doas,

/usr/local/etc/doas.conf

must be created. Refer to doas.conf(5) for further details.

Note: In order to be able to run most desktop (GUI) applications, the user
needs to have the keepenv keyword specified. If keepenv is not specified then
key elements, like the user's $HOME variable, will be reset and cause the GUI
application to crash.

Users who only need to run command line applications can usually get away
without keepenv.

When in doubt, try to avoid using keepenv as it is less secure to have
environment variables passed to privileged users.

If you installed the GITWEB option please follow these instructions:

In the directory /usr/local/share/examples/git/gitweb you can find all files to

All you have to do to make gitweb work is:
1) Please be sure you're able to execute CGI scripts in

2) Set the GITWEB_CONFIG variable in your webserver's config to
   /usr/local/etc/git/gitweb.conf. This variable is passed to gitweb.cgi.
3) Restart server.


If you installed the CONTRIB option please note that the scripts are
installed in /usr/local/share/git-core/contrib. Some of them require
other ports to be installed (perl, python, etc), which you may need to
install manually.

Message from pulseaudio-13.0:

--
Pulseaudio tries to determine default values for FreeBSD OSS driver at first
start, based on /dev/sndstat output. The hw.snd.default_unit sysctl may affect
these values, but restart of the Pulseaudio might be needed to rescan it again,
e.g. `pacmd exit`.

Pulseaudio has separate input and output configure lines. You can change them
with using following commands:

To change the default sink (output):
# pacmd set-default-sink 3
To change the default source (input):
# pacmd set-default-source 3

This can also be set in /usr/local/etc/pulse/default.pa

Replace the number '3' with the new default you want to set.

## Missing features

Some features found on Windows, macOS and Linux are not implemented:

- Native audio (requires OSS backend, feature parity with ALSA or PulseAudio)
- Encrypted Media Extensions (requires Widevine CDM binary)
- Process sandboxing (requires Capsicum backend)
- Reduced memory usage (requires mozjemalloc)
- Crash Reporter (requires Google Breakpad and reproducible builds)
- Performance profiling (requires GeckoProfiler)
- Gamepad API (requires libusbhid backend)
- WebVR (requires open source runtime)
- TCP fast open
- `about:networking` (requires link state notification)

## Crashes on FreeBSD 11.2

Web Content process may frequently crash due to a [kernel bug].
Either upgrade to FreeBSD 11.3 or try the following workaround:

    $ sysctl net.local.stream.recvspace=16384

[kernel bug]: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=181741

## Audio backend

To select non-default audio backend open `about:config` page and
create `media.cubeb.backend` preference. Supported values are: `alsa`,
`jack`, `pulse`, `pulse-rust`, `sndio`. Currently used backend can be
inspected on `about:support` page.

## smb:// issues
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

## sftp://
Only sftp access using public key authentication works. To easily
setup public key authentication to `remote_host`:

    $ ssh-keygen
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH server on `remote_host` must allow pub key authentication.

Your SDL library has been built with libvgl support, which means that you

VirtualBox was installed.

You need to load the vboxdrv kernel module via /boot/loader.conf:

vboxdrv_load="YES"

You also have to add all users to your vboxusers group in order to use vbox.

% pw groupmod vboxusers -m jerry

Reboot the machine to load the needed kernel modules.


Bridging Support:
=================

For bridged networking please add the following line to your /etc/rc.conf:

vboxnet_enable="YES"


USB Support:
============

For USB support your user needs to be in the operator group and needs read
and write permissions to the USB device.

% pw groupmod operator -m jerry

Add the following to /etc/devfs.rules (create if it doesn't exist):

[system=10]
add path 'usb/*' mode 0660 group operator

To load these new rule add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

devfs_system_ruleset="system"

Then restart devfs to load the new rules:

% /etc/rc.d/devfs restart


Troubleshooting:
================

Running VirtualBox as non-root user may fail with a fatal error
NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED. In this case delete /tmp/.vbox-*-ipc file.

If you experience "Network: write Failed: Cannot allocate memory" errors
try to increase net.graph.maxdata in /boot/loader.conf

If you are using AIO, then increase these limits (PR#168298):
vfs.aio.max_buf_aio=8192
vfs.aio.max_aio_queue_per_proc=65536
vfs.aio.max_aio_per_proc=8192
vfs.aio.max_aio_queue=65536
To check if AIO is used use: kldstat -v | grep aio
