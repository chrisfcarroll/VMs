Bootstrap scripts for
- A [complete secured Wordpress on Centos Server](/CentOs)
    - this is the main thing in this repo.

- Basic setup of BSD dev machines
    - these are intended to navigate the varieties of package management for BSD flavours and get
      the basics for a dev desktop machine up and running

Scripts names `bootstrap*.ps1` are intended to run on your own machine in either
bash or powershell (your preference!), and to bootstrap the copying and running 
of files to the target machine.
